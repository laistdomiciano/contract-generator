# contract-generator
WIP project Contract Generator. More to come soon

Project Overview
The contract generator program will allow users to fill out a form with specific details, which will then populate predefined contract templates with the input data. The resulting contract will be available for download as a .doc file.

# Steps and Main Functions

## 1. Requirements Gathering
Identify the types of contracts to be generated.
Define the fields required for each contract.
Determine the user interface requirements.
Establish the .doc file format requirements.

## 2. Project Planning
Create a timeline with milestones.
Assign tasks to team members.
Establish a development and testing environment.

## 3. System Design
Architecture Design: Design the overall architecture of the system, including the front-end, back-end, and database components.
Database Design: Design the database schema to store user inputs and contract templates.
Template Design: Define the format for the contract templates with placeholders for dynamic data.

## 4. Front-End Development
HTML Form Creation: Develop the HTML form for user input.
CSS Styling: Style the form and other front-end components using CSS.
JavaScript Validation: Implement client-side validation for form inputs.

## 5. Back-End Development
Flask App Setup: Set up a Flask application to handle requests.
Form Handling: Write Python code to handle form submissions and process data.
Template Processing: Implement logic to replace placeholders in contract templates with user-provided data.
Document Generation: Use a library like python-docx to generate .doc files from the processed templates.

## 6. Integration
Front-End and Back-End Integration: Ensure seamless communication between the front-end form and back-end processing.
Testing and Debugging: Perform unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests to identify and fix issues.

## 7. Deployment
 - Server Setup: Prepare a server for hosting the application.
Deployment: Deploy the Flask application to the server.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Set up monitoring for performance and errors, and plan for regular maintenance.
